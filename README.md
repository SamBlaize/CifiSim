# CifiSim
Badly made but working sim for Knox in CIFI.

Yes I did it all in one file, yes a lot of it is in int main(). Perfection is the enemy of good, I'm just happy it works at all, and is pretty fast honestly. I would've probably planned it a bit better but I thought I'd give up after a while, since this is my first time programming at all in 10+ years. Ended up being a really fun little project.

You're gonna have to compile it yourself if you wanna try it because I don't really want to add input. Might add reading from a json file at some point but probably not.
