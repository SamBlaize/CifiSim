# CifiSim
Badly made but working sim for Knox in CIFI.

Yes I did it all in one file, yes a lot of it is in int main(). Perfection is the enemy of good, I'm just happy it works at all, and is pretty fast honestly. You're gonna have to compile it yourself if you wanna try it because I don't really want to add input. Might add reading from a json file at some point but probably not.
